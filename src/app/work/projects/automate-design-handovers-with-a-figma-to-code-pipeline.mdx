## Overview

For this project, I developed a comprehensive inventory management system aimed at streamlining data handling and enhancing user interactions. The core technologies used were Next.js for server-side rendering and dynamic routing, Prisma ORM for seamless database management with PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS combined with ShadCN UI library to build a responsive, visually appealing interface.


## Key Features

- **Order and Return Tracking**: Developed a system to track order and return statuses, updating inventory levels in real-time. This integration ensured accurate stock management and improved customer satisfaction.
- **Inventory Item Management**: Implemented an automated inventory item tracking system, allowing easy addition, editing, and deletion of items. This streamlined backend processes, enabling faster inventory updates with minimal manual intervention.
- **QR Code Scanner**: Integrated a QR code scanning feature for quick inventory checks and real-time updates, reducing manual entry errors and improving efficiency.
- **Scalable Interface**: Built a responsive, scalable interface using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI, ensuring consistency across devices and easy expansion as the application grows.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: For extracting design tokens and component data directly from the Figma designs.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
