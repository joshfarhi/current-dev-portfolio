Elementor's design flexibility helped overcome styling limitations, while WooCommerce extensions were tailored to meet Zoots' specific e-commerce requirements.

Maintaining compliance with cannabis industry regulations was crucial. WooCommerceâ€™s adaptability allowed for seamless integration of compliance-related features, ensuring legal adherence.
