## Introduction

As a **remote front-end developer**, I’ve embraced the flexibility that comes with working from anywhere. This past summer, I spent two months in **West Philadelphia**, balancing the development of an inventory management app with personal activities like **dog sitting**, staying active through **ClassPass** fitness classes, and helping friends move into the house we rented. I even celebrated my birthday, enjoyed Korean BBQ, and somehow ended up watching a friend’s bandmate’s dog during one of their shows.

This post highlights how I juggled remote work, fitness, dog sitting, and memorable personal experiences, all while exploring a new city.

## Why Philadelphia?

Philadelphia became an ideal place for my remote work stint because my girlfriend needed to move her belongings from Philadelphia to Phoenix, her hometown in Arizona. It made sense for us to stay in **West Philadelphia**, where she could finalize the move, and I could focus on my work. Being near **Cobbs Creek** provided a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere for focused work sessions, while also offering easy access to the city’s vibrant culture and activities.

Living in this area allowed me to maintain a productive schedule for development, enjoy outdoor spaces, and easily explore different parts of the city.

## Dog Sitting Cody: A Well-Behaved Senior Companion

One of the best parts of my time in Philadelphia was **dog sitting** a sweet 14-year-old **black Lab-Boxer mix** named **Cody**. Cody quickly became a part of my routine, and taking care of him was a relaxing and enjoyable experience.

- **Daily walks in Cobbs Creek Park**: Cody loved our daily walks through **Cobbs Creek Park**, and these outings became an essential part of my day. His enthusiasm for our walks was contagious, and it was the perfect way to start each morning before diving into work.
- **A calm, well-behaved companion**: Cody was incredibly well-behaved and a joy to look after. Whether I was coding or taking a break, he was always there, quietly lounging or happily awaiting his next walk.
- **Missing us after we left**: When Cody’s owner returned, she mentioned that Cody **missed us** for a few days. Knowing that Cody enjoyed our time together so much was heartwarming, and my girlfriend and I were invited back for dinner with Cody and his owner. It was great to see Cody again and reminisce about our time spent together.

Dog sitting Cody added a calming rhythm to my days, making my remote work experience in Philadelphia feel more personal and connected.

## Celebrating My Birthday in Philadelphia

While in Philadelphia, I also celebrated my **birthday on September 2nd**, which became a day full of great food and wonderful company.

- **Korean BBQ dinner with my girlfriend**: For my birthday dinner, my girlfriend and I enjoyed a fantastic **Korean BBQ** meal. The food was delicious, and it was the perfect way to celebrate while exploring Philadelphia’s diverse food scene.
- **Banana birthday cake**: My friends surprised me with a homemade **banana cake**, adding a personal and sweet touch to the celebration. Sharing the cake with them made the day even more special, especially while being away from home.

Celebrating my birthday in a new city, surrounded by friends and great food, made for a memorable day.

## Helping Friends Move into Our Rental House

As our two-month stay in Philadelphia came to an end, my girlfriend and I helped our friends move into the house we had been renting. It was a fun and meaningful way to wrap up our time in the city, knowing that the space would be passed on to people we cared about.

- **Moving day**: We spent our final days in West Philadelphia helping our friends move into the house. It was a smooth transition, and it felt great to help them settle in as we prepared to leave.
- **Saying goodbye to the neighborhood**: Moving out and seeing our friends take over the space gave us a sense of closure and completion. Knowing they would enjoy the same space that we had made it easier to say goodbye to West Philly.

This experience helped us reflect on the time we spent in Philadelphia and the meaningful connections we made while living there.

## Attending a Friend’s Band Show (and Dog Sitting Again)

Before we left Philadelphia, our friend (who plays **drums in a band**) invited us to one of their shows. It was a great way to celebrate the end of our stay, but as fate would have it, my girlfriend and I somehow ended up **dog sitting** during the performance.

- **Attending the show**: Our friend invited us to their band’s performance, and it was exciting to support them while enjoying live music in the city.
- **Watching the bandmate’s dog**: During the show, my girlfriend and I ended up **watching one of the bandmate’s dogs**. It was an unexpected but fun turn of events that added even more personality to our experience in Philadelphia.

Being able to help out and watch the show at the same time made for a unique and memorable final weekend in the city. It was yet another reminder of the community and friendships we built during our stay.

## Using ClassPass to Stay Active: Judo, Ju-jutsu, Karate, and CrossFit

While working remotely, staying active was important to me. My girlfriend and I used **ClassPass trial passes** to explore different **martial arts** and **fitness classes** throughout Philadelphia. These activities became a fun and energizing part of our routine, helping us stay fit and motivated during our stay.

Here are some of the classes we tried:

- **Judo**: We took Judo classes, where we learned various throwing and grappling techniques. It was an intense, full-body workout that left us feeling accomplished and energized.
- **Ju-jutsu**: Ju-jutsu classes focused on ground-fighting and self-defense techniques, challenging us both physically and mentally.
- **Karate**: The Karate sessions taught us discipline, striking techniques, and balance, adding a traditional martial arts practice to our routine.
- **CrossFit**: For variety, we also tried **CrossFit**, which offered high-intensity interval training. The combination of strength training and cardio pushed us to our limits, but it was a great way to stay in shape.

These fitness classes were a fun way to break up the workweek, keeping us physically active while exploring new skills and pushing ourselves in different ways.

## Developing the App

While enjoying all these activities, the primary focus of my time in Philadelphia was developing an inventory management app. Here’s how I tackled the project:

### **Solo Development Work**

For most of the development, I worked solo, allowing me to dive deep into the technical aspects of the project:

- **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**: I used **Next.js 14** for its **server-side rendering (SSR)** capabilities and built the UI with **Tailwind CSS** for a fast and responsive design. This setup allowed for a smooth user experience with minimal load times.
- **Real-time inventory tracking**: I developed the real-time inventory system using **Prisma** and **PostgreSQL**, ensuring that the app could handle inventory updates in real time as orders were processed.
- **QR code integration**: One of the key features was a **QR code scanning** system, which allowed users to quickly update inventory levels by scanning product codes, reducing manual errors and increasing efficiency.

### **Collaborating with My Girlfriend**

While I handled the bulk of the development, my girlfriend—who is also a **front-end developer**—helped out with key areas of the project:

- **UI design enhancements**: We worked together on refining the **UI design** using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a consistent, visually appealing user experience across devices.
- **Clerk Auth integration**: She also helped with integrating **Clerk Auth**, which allowed for secure user authentication and a seamless login experience.

Our collaboration made the process smoother and more enjoyable, ensuring that the app was built to a high standard.

## Key Takeaways from My Remote Developer Journey

### **Routine and Flexibility**
Maintaining a structured routine is key when balancing **remote work**, **fitness**, and **dog sitting**. My daily routine—starting with walks with Cody, followed by focused work sessions and evening fitness classes—helped me stay productive and energized throughout my time in Philadelphia.

### **The Power of Collaboration**
While working solo on a project can be rewarding, collaborating with my girlfriend on certain aspects added an extra layer of creativity and problem-solving. It was a great reminder of the importance of teamwork, even when working remotely.

### **Staying Active Through ClassPass**
Using **ClassPass** to stay active during my time in Philadelphia helped me maintain a healthy balance between work and physical activity. Trying new fitness classes like **Judo**, **Karate**, and **CrossFit** kept me motivated, energized, and focused during long coding sessions.
