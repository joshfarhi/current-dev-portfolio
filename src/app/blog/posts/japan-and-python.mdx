# My 10 Day Trip to Japan and Remote Work with Python

## Introduction

I recently took a trip with my partner to Japan and worked remotely in some of the most beutiful spots in all of Japan. This trip was definitely memorible, from the heart-found experiences with my partner to the crazy ending of me being denied entry into South Korea--I will explain that last.

## The Trip

### Tokyo

Japan's capital city, Tokyo, is a bustling metropolis that seamlessly blends modernity with tradition. From the towering skyscrapers of Shinjuku to the historic temples of Asakusa, Tokyo offers a diverse range of experiences. Highlights of my visit included exploring the vibrant neighborhoods of Shibuya and Harajuku, visiting the serene Meiji Shrine, and enjoying the panoramic views from Tokyo Tower.

### Osaka

Osaka is known for its modern architecture, nightlife, and hearty street food. The city's vibrant atmosphere is infectious, and I enjoyed exploring the bustling Dotonbori district, famous for its neon lights and delicious street food. A visit to Osaka Castle provided a glimpse into Japan's rich history, and the Umeda Sky Building offered stunning views of the city.

### Kyoto

Kyoto, with its well-preserved temples, traditional wooden houses, and beautiful gardens, is a city that exudes tranquility and history. I visited iconic sites such as the Fushimi Inari Shrine with its thousands of torii gates, the Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji), and the serene Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. Each location offered a unique glimpse into Japan's cultural heritage.

### Nara

Nara, a city known for its friendly deer and ancient temples, was a delightful day trip. The Todai-ji Temple, home to the Great Buddha statue, was awe-inspiring. Walking through Nara Park and interacting with the deer was a memorable experience, and the Kasuga Taisha Shrine with its lantern-lined paths added to the city's charm.

## Here's where the Python comes in..

While enjoying my trip, I had a commitment to a client who needed help organizing her inventory. She had hundreds of product images that needed to be cataloged and imported into her WooCommerce store. Given the time difference and my travel schedule, I needed an efficient way to handle this task remotely.

## Using Python to Solve the Problem

To tackle this challenge, I decided to use Python. Python is a versatile programming language that is well-suited for tasks involving file manipulation and data processing. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how I approached the problem:

1. **Reading Image Files**: I wrote a Python script to read all the image files from a specified directory.
2. **Extracting Metadata**: For each image, I extracted relevant metadata such as the file name and creation date.
3. **Creating a CSV File**: I organized the extracted data into a CSV file format that could be easily imported into WooCommerce.
