## Project Overview

I partnered with **Cherrie**, a very kind and talented card maker, to develop a professional, SEO-optimized e-commerce website for her business, **[CK Handcrafted Cards](https://ckhandcraftedcards.com)**. Cherrie had around 900 cards she was having trouble uploading to an e-commerce platform. Utilizing **WordPress** and **Elementor**, the site showcases her unique handcrafted cards, with **WooCommerce** providing robust e-commerce functionality for product listings and secure customer transactions. I also created a custom Python script to read the image files and turn them into a CSV that could be imported into WooCommerce.

## Technologies Used

- **WordPress**: Chosen for its flexibility and user-friendly content management, allowing Cherrie to easily update and manage her website content.
- **Elementor**: Employed to create a visually appealing, responsive design, offering precise control over the site's layout and customization.
- **WooCommerce**: Integrated to handle e-commerce operations, including product listing, inventory management, and a smooth checkout process, tailored to meet industry standards and Cherrie's specific needs.
- **Python**: Used to develop a custom script that read image files and converted them into a CSV file for easy import into WooCommerce.

## Key Features

- **Custom Product Pages**: Designed with WooCommerce to feature detailed product descriptions, high-quality images, and categorization, enhancing user experience and simplifying product browsing.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Elementor, ensuring the site is fully responsive across all devices, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile.
- **Seamless Checkout**: Implemented WooCommerce to manage secure transactions, with streamlined checkout flows for a straightforward purchasing experience.
- **Easy Content Management**: WordPress offers Cherrie a user-friendly backend to update products, manage inventory, and edit content without technical barriers.
- **Custom Python Script**: Developed to automate the process of reading image files and converting them into a CSV file for WooCommerce import, saving Cherrie significant time and effort.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenges included **customizing WooCommerce** to align with Cherrie's branding and product structure, and ensuring **optimal performance** across all devices. Elementor's design flexibility helped overcome styling limitations, while WooCommerce extensions were tailored to meet Cherrie's specific e-commerce requirements.

Creating the custom Python script was a key learning experience, as it required precise handling of image metadata and CSV formatting to ensure seamless integration with WooCommerce.

## Outcome

The website effectively showcases CK Handcrafted Cards' product line, providing customers with an engaging, intuitive shopping experience. The responsive design, combined with streamlined product browsing and checkout features, has boosted online sales and provided Cherrie with a reliable platform for scaling her online presence.

This project highlights the power of **WordPress and WooCommerce** as a combined solution for e-commerce, particularly when customized with **Elementor** for advanced design needs. The addition of a **custom Python script** demonstrates the importance of automation in managing large product inventories. The result is a user-friendly, visually engaging website that allows Cherrie to manage content, update products, and serve her customers effectively.
